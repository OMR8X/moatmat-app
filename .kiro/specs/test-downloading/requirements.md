## Introduction

The Test Downloading feature allows users to download and cache test assets for offline access. This feature will extract all assets (videos, images, files) from a test object and download them individually, showing the download progress to the user. The feature will utilize the existing asset caching system and will be managed through a dedicated BLoC.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to download all test assets before starting a test, so that I can access the test offline without interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the download test view with a test ID THEN the system SHALL retrieve the test object using the getTestById method.
2. WHEN the test object is retrieved THEN the system SHALL extract all assets from the test object including videos, images, and files.
3. WHEN assets are extracted THEN the system SHALL categorize them into test assets and question assets.
4. WHEN assets are categorized THEN the system SHALL display them in a list of download cards.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see the download progress for each asset, so that I know which files are being downloaded and when they will be ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an asset is being downloaded THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing the download percentage.
2. WHEN an asset download is completed THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show a completion status.
3. WHEN multiple assets are queued for download THEN the system SHALL download them sequentially and show which asset is currently being downloaded.
4. WHEN an asset fails to download THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide an option to retry.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see different icons for different types of assets, so that I can easily identify what type of content I'm downloading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a video asset THEN the system SHALL show a video icon.
2. WHEN displaying an image asset THEN the system SHALL show an image icon.
3. WHEN displaying a document asset THEN the system SHALL show a file icon.
4. WHEN displaying any other type of asset THEN the system SHALL show a generic file icon.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a BLoC pattern for the download test feature, so that the state management is consistent with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the download test feature THEN the system SHALL use a BLoC pattern for state management.
2. WHEN the download state changes THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate states through the BLoC.
3. WHEN a user initiates a download THEN the system SHALL dispatch appropriate events to the BLoC.
4. WHEN the BLoC processes events THEN the system SHALL use the Cache Asset Use Case to handle the actual downloading.
